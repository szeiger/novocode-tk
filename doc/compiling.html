<H1>Compiling the Toolkit</H1>

<P>Starting with release 1.4, Novocode Toolkit is built using a
<A href="../build.xml">build script</A> for <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ANT</a>.
If you have got an official release that you don't want to modify, you can
simply use the pre-built binaries and API documentation. If you have made
modifications or pulled a version off the CVS repository, you need to run ANT
to rebuild the project. Use "<code>ant -projecthelp</code>" to get a list of available build
targets.
</P>

<P>Since Novocode Toolkit is now managed as an Eclipse 2.1 project, you can
also <a href="availability.html#eclipse">import it into your Eclipse
workspace</a> and let Eclipse take care of compiling the source files. The
build script can also be run from within Eclipse.
</P>
