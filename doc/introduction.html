<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P><EM>The Novocode Toolkit is a collection of general-purpose Java
classes.</EM> It includes some useful AWT components, a package for
decoding MIME data, an Input- to OutputStream connector, the byte-based
string class ByteString plus assorted classes, some ClassLoaders, Base16
and Base64 encoders and decoders, an event scheduler and many other
useful things.</P>

<P><EM>The Toolkit classes are not academic creations.</EM> They
were written as part of the commercial projects
<A href="http://www.novocode.com/prod/nf/">NetForge</A> and
<A href="http://www.novocode.com/prod/mc/">Metaconf</A>. Some classes
were used only in experimental versions of these programs but most of
them have been in use for a long time during the evolution of the
projects and are still in use today.</P>

<P><EM>The Toolkit does not try to replace Java APIs by emulating
C or C++ APIs.</EM> If you write Java programs, do it the Java way.
I've tried to make the classes modular, reusable and in line with
the Java core APIs. The classes are based on Java 1.1, so they
probably duplicate some of the new features of Java 2.</P>
